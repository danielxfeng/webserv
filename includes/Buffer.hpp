/**
 * @brief A buffer class with reference-counted blocks and optional chunked transfer parsing.
 * @details
 * This buffer manages blocks of strings with string_view references, allowing zero-copy reads/writes.
 *
 * ## Normal mode
 * - Supports reading from and writing to file descriptors.
 * - Blocks are appended as needed, views track the readable region, reference counting ensures blocks are freed when no longer used.
 *
 * ## Chunked transfer encoding mode
 * It's the tricky part.
 * For each read, we may receive several chunks, or a partial chunk.
 * For a partial chunk, it may be a partial header, or a partial body, or a partial CRLF delimiter.
 *
 * It would be difficult to parse the chunked data across buffer blocks,
 * so we use another string_view, a FSM, and some state variables to handle the chunked parsing.
 *
 * And we also apply 2 rules during the processing:
 * 1. Ensure chunk header and trailing CRLF are not split across blocks.
 * 2. Chunked bodies can span multiple blocks.
 *
 * ## Why we couple the chunked parsing with the buffer class?
 * - We cannot defer parsing with an large buffer, since input may exceed available memory.
 * - Using a temporary file introduces an extra data copy.
 * - imo, handling chunked parsing in Buffer is efficient and nearly zero-copy,
 *   tho brings lots of complexity, and does not follow single-responsibility, as a cost.
 *   But I don't have better ideas now.
