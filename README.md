# webserv
A simple C++ Web Server

## Description

Webserv is part of a the 42 core curriculum, and is meant to teach students networking at a low level. As such this server is meant to mimic nginx in its behavior, though not structure. To make it single-threaded, non-blocking, as well as prevent crashes it is structured as a finite state machine with a scheduler. It also includes two CGI methods, one in Python and one in Go.
